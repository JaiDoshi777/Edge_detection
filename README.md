# Edge_detection

This project focuses on image processing, specifically object and edge detection, using OpenCV and various image processing techniques. 
1.	Gradient Calculations:
•	Sobel Operator: The code calculates the gradients of an image using the Sobel operator in both the x and y directions. This helps in detecting edges in the image by highlighting regions of high intensity change.
o	sobelx: Gradient in the x direction.
o	sobely: Gradient in the y direction.

2.	Laplacian Operator:
•	The Laplacian operator is applied to the image to calculate the second-order derivatives, which help in identifying regions where the intensity changes rapidly in both x and y directions.

4.	Blending Gradients:
•	The gradients in the x and y directions are blended together to combine the edge information from both directions.

6.	Thresholding:
•	A binary threshold is applied to the image to create a binary representation, where pixels above a certain intensity value are set to the maximum value, and others are set to zero. This helps in highlighting specific features in the image.

7.	Morphological Gradient:
•	The morphological gradient operation is applied to the blended gradients using a kernel. This operation helps in enhancing the edges and features in the image.
